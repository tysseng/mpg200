/*
 A program for measuring musical frequencies. Adapted from johnt's CCP test
 program found at http://www.mikroe.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=88&t=26489
 
 The program measures a pulse train on the CCP1 input pin (PORTC.B2) and
 calculates the input frequency through an average of 16 samples.
 
 The result is accurate down to +/- 0.1 Hz, which is good enough for audio
 frequencies as the human ear cannot distinguish between changes less than 3 Hz.

 HARDWARE:
       The code is written for PIC18F458 at 20MHz.
       T1 is a 16 bit counter in free running mode is used to capture pulse widths
       PORTC Pin 2 is used for input
       PORTB is used for an LCD display, connected to the default pins of the
       Mikroelektronika EasyPIC3 development board.
 
  Written using MicroC PRO for PIC v 4.60
  
  If changing the operating speed, you must take care so that T1 does not over-
  flow.

  The current implementation seems to be accurate for frequencies in the range
  150Hz to 6.4kHz. (saw waves. clean square waves will be measureable all the
  way down to 77Hz without a prescaler. With a 1:4 prescaler, frequencies down
  to 20Hz seem measureable. Similarly, a 1:8 prescaler will let you measure
  down to 10Hz.

  To interface the circuit with an audio signal, an external circuit is
  necessary. Ex: To convert a +/- 15V sine or similar signal into a 0-5v input
  pulse, the following circuit can be used (though it requires a triple-
  value power supply):

                   LM311 comparator        /--------------> output to PORTC.B2
                       ------              |
  GND   <-------------|1    8|---> +15V    |
  Input <-------------|2    7|-------------o-[ 1kOhm pull up resistor ]--> +5V
  GND   <-------------|3    6|---\ (connect pin 5 to pin 6)
  -15V  <-------------|4    5|---/
                       ------

// How to accurately measure the delay between when an interrupt occurs and 
// the time T1 is restarted (PIC18):
// - Every interrupt has a latency of three instruction cycles.
// - Each instruction takes two cycles, but the instruction pipeline handles
//   two instructions at the time, meaning instructions only take one cycle in
//   practice.
// - If a branch/goto is triggered, the pipeline is reset and the first
//   instruction takes two cycles.

// In this code:
// 3 instructions interrupt latency
// 2 instructions in C, none of which triggers a branch.
// 11 instructions in assembly
// = 16 cycles. 

// NB: For some reason the correct number to add to the timer when
// calculating the correct frequency is always two more than this.
// I am not sure where the last cycles go, could it be interrupt jitter?
